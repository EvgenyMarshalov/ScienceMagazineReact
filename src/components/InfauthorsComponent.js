               <h2>Information for authors</h2>
               <h4>Preparing your article</h4>
               <p>Please take care to follow the Royal Society Publishing Instructions for Authors when preparing your article for submission. Our editorial policies can be found here. Please read these carefully before submission, paying particular attention to our ethics, open data and open access policies.</p>
               <p>There are no length restrictions on submissions to Open Biology though we ask that submissions are as succinct as possible. There are also no charges for colour figures.</p>
               <p>Continuous line numbering should be used on your submitted manuscript to make it easier for editors and reviewers to assess your work.</p>
               <p>Manuscripts must be submitted in English, and a number of language editing services are available for authors whose first language is not English. Manuscripts that do not meet the required English language standard (where the quality of the science is obscured by the quality of the language) will be returned to the authors. Authors whose papers are returned on language grounds must provide evidence that a professional language editing service or a native speaker of English have assisted in preparing a revised manuscript. Evidence such as a certificate of editing or a signed letter from a native speaker of English would be acceptable.</p>
               <h4>Processing your manuscript</h4>
               <p>All manuscripts are assigned to a specialist member of the Editorial Board, who advises the Subject Editor on the suitability of the manuscript for Open Biology based on scientific quality, interest and importance. Based on this, the Subject Editor decides whether the paper should be sent for full peer-review.</p>
               <p>The Subject Editors are responsible for all final editorial decisions and make these decisions based on the reports received from the referees and Board Members.</p>
               <p>Our journal reserves the right to reject a paper if we cannot find referees.</p>
               <p>If your article is declined by Open Biology on the basis of scope, editors may provide the opportunity to transfer the manuscript and peer review reports to Royal Society Open Science - which considers high-quality, scientifically rigorous original research across the entire range of science.</p>
               <h4>Promoting your published article</h4>
               <p>There are a number of ways you can promote your paper after publication to maximise impact. This blog post provides our top tips for ensuring your paper is seen by a wide and relevant audience.</p>
               <p>Our journal is committed to the efforts undertaken by the Royal Society and Royal Society Publishing to make users of our services aware of and responsive to the challenges posed by unconscious biases. As part of these efforts, the Royal Society has published an In Verba blog post, a guidance PDF, and short video animation to support users in understanding and tackling unconscious bias. Our authors are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with these publications when considering submitting to the journal.</p>
